The **__[dataset](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Introduction-to-Python-for-machine-learning/files/7768140/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv)__** is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 

Features include: Area Code','Area', 'Item Code', 'Item', 'Element Code', 'Element','Unit', 'Y2014', 'Y2015', 'Y2016', 'Y2017', 'Y2018'.

**Note:** When loading the Dataset for the Quiz,  an encoding value of “latin-1” should be added to the code when reading the file. <br>



**Stage B (Machine Learning: Regression - Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings)**
---

The **__[dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eru_UHVc3WLHVveC9Q8K9QUxlzYeHt18/view?usp=share_link)__** for the remainder of this quiz (from question 18) is the Appliances Energy Prediction data. The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10-minute periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. 
Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non-predictive attributes (parameters). The attribute information can be seen below.


**Stage C (Machine Learning: Regression - Telco Customer Churn)**
---

The Predict behaviour to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

Each row of the __[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)__ represents a customer, each column contains the customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

* Services that each customer has signed up for : phone, multiple lines, Internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
